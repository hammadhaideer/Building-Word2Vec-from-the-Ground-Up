# Word2Vec Model from Scratch Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of the Word2Vec model using Python. The Word2Vec algorithm is a key technique in natural language processing for creating word embeddings.

## Overview

This code trains a Word2Vec model on the Brown corpus, retrieves the vector for the word "king," and finds words that are similar to "king."

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word2vec_from_scratch.git
    cd word2vec_from_scratch
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the Word2Vec model, execute the following command:
```bash
python word2vec_from_scratch.py
